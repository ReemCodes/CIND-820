      "Comment: The lovely neighborhood is filled with squirrels, birds and even the occasional raccoon.  The beach is a short walk down the street, with a lovely boardwalk to an adjacent park.  Walking the other direction the same distance you find international restaurants, bars, shopping and entertainment in small beach city spots.  Notice I speak of walking, safely, confidently until late into the evening, surrounded by kind, helpful residents.  As a woman traveling alone, it was a welcome change of pace. Robert, my host, offered a bounty of information about local services and attractions.  This trip was for business, my next trip will be for fun.  There is so much to do here! Robert's place is cozy with great internet.  The kitchen is full service with quality accouterments.  The bed is divine.  You will have access to the full-size laundry, which is great with the beach down the street. Be sure to try the three chocolate shops on Queen Street. https://www.google.com/search?q=chocolate+shop+in+the+beaches&oq=chocolate+in+beachs+&aqs=chrome.2.69i57j0l3.13180j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8 Whatever you do, be sure plan to stay an extra day because you will wish for the time to do those things you didn't realize would call to you.

The apartment is in a great location--very near Little Portugal/Little Italy/Koreantown--and we enjoyed walking to many parts of the City.  The apartment itself is even better than the photos - 2 floors, very open, lots of sunlight, and a great view of the CNN Tower and skyline from the deck on the outside stairwell.  Walls and shelves hold cool art and objects from our host's global travels.  Friends who live in Toronto visited us to enjoy dessert and were highly complimentary--even envious--of the apartment.  Carey made sure we had whatever we needed and generously shared the contents of her refrigerator with us and even had a nice bottle of wine waiting to welcome us.  Our only note is that if you have a car (and we did as we drove to Toronto), you will want to obtain a temporary street parking permit.  It was very easy to do and I obtained it before we even left for Toronto:\n",

Right on Blue Jays Way and Wellington so in two blocks you are at the Blue Jays stadium or the CN Tower and another block or so and you are at the waterfront area.  It's also just a couple of blocks from Queen Street and all the fun shopping and restaurants. The rooftop terrace has a magnificent view of the CN Tower and the lake which is beautiful both day and night.  We walked to a great Crepe place on Queen Street every night for a late night snack. We also loved having free parking and drove up to Kew Beach and spent a day at the beach since the weather was gorgeous.

      "Comment: I stayed 4 weeks in the apartment with my 10 month old baby. Check in was super easy and Xander was amazing at responding to every little enquiry I had, often within the hour and at any time of night!  The apartment was cosy with a great Netflix setup. The kitchen was well stocked and the bed super comfy. It's a 10min walk from subway and Greek Town restaurants and banks.  Only small comments I have is you can hear noises from upstairs occasionally, the drier makes a screechy noise when turning it on that eventually goes away (luckily my baby slept through the noise no problem), and I managed to trip the power plugs in the kitchen by turning on a couple appliances as the same time. This is super easy to fix though as the switchboard is above the bed in the bedroom.  Otherwise I highly recommend staying here! Would do so again. A side note/tip for anyone with a baby.

      "Comment: My wife and I are Canadian expats living in the states. We decided to spend a few months in Canada, taking refuge from CovidPalooza, and booked Menelika's place to sit out our quarantine period. Menelika was a fantastic host, coordinating a smooth check-in with great communication, and her place was clean, nicely sized for two people (could be tight for more, depending on how much you all like each other), and most importantly in today's age of remote work - had great wifi. We stayed an additional two weeks following the end of our quarantine period, and loved the Liberty Village location. It's a highly-walkable neighbourhood and is close to everything Toronto has to offer. If there is one caveat for me to give, it is probably to do with parking. There were no guest passes available during our stay, and parking enforcement in the neighbourhood is fierce. So, if you are planning to bring your car and need parking, it is VITAL that you get a temporary parking permit from the City of Toronto ahead of time. Here's a link for you: https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/streets-parking-transportation/applying-for-a-parking-permit/temporary-on-street-parking/ I would definitely recommend Menelika's place, and would be happy to stay there again sometime.\n",

      " This made for a very awkward and uncomfortable moment as I didn’t have any cash on me. I was traveling from the US to Toronto and hadn’t had the opportunity to go to the ATM. This was also a bit of an inconvenience as I had to go to a currency exchange in order to get US dollars (she said she would accept either US or CAD) as I didn’t want to be stuck with CAD when the security deposit was returned to me (at the end of my stay) as I would not be able to do anything with that currency back home. While I have no problem paying a security deposit, I just wish I was notified earlier. Moreover, I think the larger problem is that this is an actual violation of airbnb’s policy, which aims to limit or rid hand-to-hand exchange of money. I’ve rented through airbnb quite a bit and have never done any type of hand-to-hand exchange of money! The security deposit should be done through airbnb where both the host and visitor are protected. Yes, I did receive my money back, but I was very leery handing over money to a complete stranger with no documentation or way of ensuring that I would get it back. Charming place and decent host, but the discomfort of the security deposit situation was very off putting.   \n",

My Wife and I stayed at their place for 45 days and from the time we made our bookings, Luke clearly communicated all the instructions (check-in, contact information, codes, etc) in a precise, timely manner. The room was cozy, clean, quiet, well-ventilated and the house as a whole was very clean and well maintained with all the facilities that one needs. The Townhouse is located in an extremely safe neighbourhood and is close to all tourist attractions and local amenities. Luke and Jamie genuinely went an extra mile to make our stay comfortable and relaxing. They even invited us for their St. Patrick’s Day house party where got to meet some amazing people from an array of backgrounds and make some acquaintances. Luke and I had several funny and intellectual conversations about travel, food, work, life in Canada etc. He is a Tea/Coffee connoisseur and annually conducts the Tea & Coffee Expo in Toronto (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxPzUaxSlaM) so you can try out some unique tea/coffee brands from his collections.

      " - Un grand merci à Damaris et son mari, leur logement est très agréable et parfaitement bien pensé à tous les points de vue. Nous sommes un couple dans la soixantaine et étions venus pour visiter, pendant une semaine, une amie travaillant à l’Alliance Française, au centre ville de Toronto. Situation du logement : dans l’entresol de la maison, comporte trois petites fenêtres, donc cela manque un peu de luminosité naturelle mais de toutes manières nous y avons principalement passé la nuit. Néanmoins, le logement manque nullement de lumière, les luminaires ont été installés de façon intelligente et sont réglables. Il n’y a pas vraiment d’isolation phonique avec les étages supérieurs mais toute la famille s’est montrée très respectueuse, ce qui, au vu de cette situation, est également attendu des visiteurs ! La cohabitation s’est donc faite en parfaite harmonie, d’autant plus que le logement dispose d’une entrée séparée qui assure indépendance et tranquillité. Néanmoins, Damaris et son mari sont toujours prêts à aider ou renseigner. La rue est très sympathique avec ses petites maisons individuelles, c’est très tranquille de jour comme de nuit. Elle est desservie par une ligne de bus très fréquente (toutes les 10 minutes jusqu’à deux heures du matin) et en changeant une seule fois pour le métro on arrive downtown en 40 minutes. Circule à la même cadence même par temps de neige, chapeau ! Equipement du logement : rien à redire, on sent bien que Damaris bichonne ses visiteurs : tout est prêt quand on arrive : draps, serviettes, produits de première nécessité dans la cuisine (dont le café, tout prêt à côté de la cafetière, merci !!) produits de toilette (shampoing, gel douche, savon mains, papier WC en grande quantité), sèche-cheveux, tout est aménagé de façon pratique. Damaris propose également un lave-vaisselle (que nous n’avons pas utilisé, à deux), une machine à laver et un sèche-linge, un fer à repasser (que nous n’avons pas utilisé non plus:) ) , ainsi qu’une super télé avec de très nombreux programmes disponibles aussi en français, un lecteur DVD. Et enfin, le clou : une cheminée à gaz, qui chauffe instantanément et diffuse en quelques minutes une douce chaleur dans tout l’appartement. Bref, pour nous un appartement qui a parfaitement répondu à nos attentes et qui nous a réservé quelques jolies surprises. Merci Damaris et son mari ! Monica et Paul\n",

      " - This was a great experience. Marina and Yuri are a very nice and friendly pair. Marina even took extra time to share her favorite restaurants and cafes in the area with me. The room is comfortable and quiet, and the common areas are exceptional, especially the kitchen. I had some concerns about a dog in the picture but I can honestly say this dog is as close to the living incarnation of \"Santa's Little Helper\" in the Simpsons as is possible with one exception. And, as a former race dog, Yuri will be proud to fill you in on Sal's fascinating pedigree backstories and numerous race victories. The exception is that instead of the slightest bit of dog-like annoying, barking, pawing, racing, slobbering, jumping, etc., Sal will simply stay put in his den room with the kitchen acting as a Lord of the Rings \"Thou shall not pass\"-style barrier. So, during the day, Sal will at most look at you from a distance and that's about it, unless you specifically decide to interact with him. However, who wouldn't want to at least pat the head of a famous dog? Hard to say. I'd guess some Simpsons and dog racing enthusiasts might even stay just to mingle with such a rare congenial celebrity like Sal. Anyway, the delicious cookies are another sweet bonus that were a treat to look forward to in the mornings and should seal the deal. Thanks Marina, Yuri and Sal.\n",

Did not even have the time to use all the things that were provided, (kitchen supplies, washer dryer, etc) and having 3 different smartTVs in the different areas of the place was such a huge plus. The bed, pillows, and down comforter was very comfortable and relaxing to come back to after a long day of being out. The instructions for parking and checking in/out were very thorough and clear, and did not run into any troubles. Thank you very much to Sergio and Andrea for the place to stay.\n",

David was friendly, easy to communicate with, and very accommodating of my check in/check out times! Location is not in the heart of downtown, but that was not something I was looking for. Even still, it was pretty close. Just a short Uber ride or a couple stops on the metro. There were grocery stores and restaurants within walking distance. Would stay again if I'm ever back in Toronto.\n",

But the location of his place was super convenient and everything was within a couple mins walking distance. I would definitely stay here again.\n",

The space itself is very accommodating for up to 4 people and is well equipped. Communication with the host is timely and check in/out is easy and quick. Although there is much construction happening around the building access in and out is not obstructed and activity ceases at the end of the work day. Our stay was very enjoyable and would come back to stay here again.\n",

The basement is clean and tidy, has enough space for 2 people, and contains everything you needs for cooking, showers and a good rest.

      " - Places like this one are the reason A&B still exists. The place is beautiful, a mini house with its own entry that allows you complete freedom to come and go at any time. The neighborhood is also lovely, full of cute houses with their own front garden <3 The location is just one and a half block from the subway station, and this particular line goes across all Toronto, so you won’t have any trouble to get anywhere. Also, no more than two small blocks away, you’ll find pubs, the cute Korean town and lots of comfortable cafes that you don’t have to miss (do yourself a favor and try Green Beanery) The host was also pure kindness. She waited for us at late night when we arrived and left us all kind of things we could need, from soap and shampoo to frozen meals in the kitchen! And it was all new and nice, not the old cutlery that was left from other days. In fact, she was so kind that she offered her address for us to order a pizza, although we didn’t accept to not disturb her. Maybe next time the door could have some sign so the guest won’t need to ask the host? If you go with a car, there's a parking lot near, but seriously, the subway is clean, clear and efficient enough to cover your necessities. Toronto is a beautiful city worth to discover, with lots of things to explore and do, beautiful parks and so much conscious about the environment and the green life that no matter where you come from, you’re going to feel like home. Also, it’s not a myth anymore, the people in Canada are actually kinder than in some other cities.\n",

We were very relieved after a long drive from Montreal to find this perfect place with so comfy bed and soft blankets. It is simple all well decorated and recently renovated so it was really cool. Fana provided me with everything I needed to make my stay enjoyable especially that I was with my baby, she gave me baby’s furniture, purees..etc. She also answered to all my inquiries about the place ´s amenities as well as local tips which were really good. She is a not only a great host but also a great person!! Thank you Fana <3\n",

I have booked attached bathroom.But bathroom is outside bedroom.As per host that is what attached bathroom. Host should tell what is that called if bathroom is inside the bedroom.  7.And dont book this by seeing photos. Those were taken when this place was new. Now its old.\n",

      " - Positiv: Ausgezeichnete Lage mit schöner Aussicht auf die Stadt und See vom 61. Stockwerk. Kontakt zum Gastgeber jederzeit zeitnah, hilfreich und freundlich. Wohnung entspricht den Fotos und der Beschreibung. Küche ist sehr gut ausgestattet. Negativ: Es stehen lediglich 3 Aufzüge zur Verfügung um in die Wohnung im 61. Stock zu gelangen. Während meinem Aufenthalt (5 Tage) war ein Aufzug permanent ausser Betrieb. Zudem fiel ein weiterer Aufzug des öfteren für kurze Zeit aus, was lange Wartezeiten, um in oder aus der Wohnung zu gelangen, zur Folge hatte. Wartezeiten > 10 Minuten um den Aufzug zu benutzen war keine Seltenheit.\n",

      " - Host communicated well and gave clear check-in and check-out instructions.  We arrived 90 mins after check-in time, at 5:30 pm, and the cleaner was still there cleaning.  We noticed that some of the towels were in the machine on a 20 minute cycle, which was concerning, as that is too short for towels.  We also noticed the duvets had some stains, suggesting they hadn't been washed.   The  location is very good as the surrounding area has easy access to public transit and a variety of restaurants. You can walk to a good number of quality restaurants within 15 minutes.   The unit had a pungent odor as soon as we arrived.  The mustiness seemed to be coming from the basement due to the water heater sitting in 4 inches of exposed standing water. The strong smell was made worse by poor ventilation and air circulation.  The room on the top floor has a window AC unit that doesn't work well, and there is no option to open the window, so was hot and very uncomfortable.  Doesn't have central AC.\n",

      " - We rented this house for 4 days (three nights) for a wedding we had downtown Toronto. We were really pleased with our choice. The price is honest. There was no need for us to rush to arrive at a specific hour since the owners are well organised with the keys (this detail was appreciated because we travel with a baby now and we were not sure about the time of the arrival). The owners provided us with a list of everything (I mean EVERYTHING) we needed to know about the house and it's surroundings. They seemed kind and opened if we had any questions. They answered quivkly to our e-mails. The house was really clean and we had everything we needed. Linens for the beds, clean towels, everything you can think of to cook, board games, etc. The house is also well decorated and big enough for 6 adults (large dining table, 3 bedrooms with comfortable beds, etc.). There is also a beautiful garden, a barbecue, a table to eat outside and a place in the back to just relax and have a gass of wine after a long day visiting this nice city. The neighbourhood is pretty cool and has everything you need: grossery stores, butchers, breakfast restaurants, places to buy your morning coffee (there is even an expresso bar), bars and pubs and a bakery. It is also a nice place, safe, just to take a walk and admire the \"vintage\" stores. There is also a Tram that take you straight downtown. The house was also easy to find. However, there is not a lot of parking places in the street, but you can park in a Parking lot for 14$/day. There is one 3 streets away from the house. The neighbourhood is also quiet, which was appreciated by all of us. We strongly recommand you rent this house if you plan on visiting Toronto with others. It was a great experience, and when we go bakc, we will rent it again.\n",

      " - The condo was exactly as described and in a great location. Lots of high end stores and restaurants in walking distance. Close to public transport and grocery store. I enjoyed using the gym in the condo and loved STK was right downstairs. They have a great happy hour.  The area (Yorkville) was safe and walkable at all hours of the day.  Condo was secure with key fob access into the building and elevators in addition to 24/7 security at front desk.  5 stars. I would recommend and rebook.\n",

The view from the 17th floor was breathtaking to say the least. Somayeh went above and beyond to make sure my stay was comfortable. To add, her communication is on point, everything within the add was exactly what it was as I got there. I would def stay again! 😊\n",

      " - Was a lovely decorated place and located in a good location with many restaurants around. However, Check in was slightly annoying as you had to wait for check in codes to be sent to you (which required wifi) so if you’re arriving from outside the country you will have to go somewhere else to find Wi-Fi and wait for the message with the code. Also, it was not clear that the couch was not a fold out one and was not set up as a bed even though 3 guests were staying. The tv remote was not working properly and the tv was difficult to use. Other than this, great amenities, very clean and secure place.\n",

      " - We couldn't have chosen a better spot for our 2 week self-isolation upon entering Canada. It is a bright (even for winter time), warm (fireplace is comforting), and airy apartment. The hosts were extremely accommodating with our check in times (since we were crossing the border with unknown ETAs), welcomed us with a white wine from Ontario, and were in constant constant (e.g. we got new batteries delivered asap since we couldn't go out and get it). For the space and location, I think the pricing is appropriate and was one of the better deals I found at the time. There is a little side patio which was nice to have some fresh air during the 2-week isolation. The kitchen is stocked with supplies, which made it convenient to cook, and there was a lot of teas supplied by the host. I would recommend our friends and family to stay here in the future (*when they can visit*)!\n",

Everything is new and clean, and it's easy to keep it clean. The place was exactly as described. Convenient bed. Keyless check-in allowed to enter effortlessly at 1 am without bothering anyone. Location is perfect, it's quiet and at the same time is very accessible: it's 5-7 minutes away from a tram, it's very easy to get to downtown or to subway station. Several large supermarkets nearby. Great value for its price. We enjoyed the stay for about 2 months here.\n",

The amenities provided were on point which we especially needed since we only came with a handful of clothes, so the laundry helped us a ton! I have to mention that I love the Keurig single-serve coffee maker plus subscriptions to Netflix and Prime to hype up our deflated spirit after a long day in the city. Needless to say, we were spoiled throughout our stay.\n",

The location was perfect, close to subway station, restaurants, shops & stores, and many attractions.  All of these pleasant things help this city make a good impression on me!

      " - All the glowing reviews are correct; Lana's place is delightful and she is a very considerate and responsive host.  This is a basement apartment but has very high ceilings and excellent windows, so does not feel like a basement. The decor is nice with thoughtful touches - we stayed in the spring and it was decorated with live flowers and an Easter-themed centerpiece.  Lana provided many little snacks and goodies in the mini-fridge and on the counter next to it, including high-quality tea and coffee. And the gas fireplace was much appreciated given the somewhat dreary, drizzly/snowy weather! The unit is located in a nice neighborhood just around the corner from a commercial intersection with coffee and restaurants and a gourmet grocery. When asked, Lana also had a couple of great suggestions for local restaurants - Maker Pizza and Maiz Yonge - that were exactly the take-out options we needed.  She was very quick to respond every time we had a question.  A couple of things to be aware of:  - Being a basement apartment, as others have mentioned, one can hear sometimes hear footsteps and a dog moving around upstairs. This was nothing that bothered me, but if you are a light sleeper you might want earplugs.  - Lana provides a mini fridge (stocked with some nice goodies as I've said - milk, cream, OJ, yogurt), a microwave, and some cereal and fresh fruit and yet more goodies on a buffet, along with a few dishes and silverware. All this is (much) better than you'd get in a hotel, but be aware that it's not a complete kitchen - no stove or toaster oven, no dishwasher or kitchen sink.  - There is one very comfortable queen bed. There is also an air mattress provided for the living room, which my son used - okay for kids, okay for adults in a pinch, but obviously less comfortable than the actual bed. The couches were large and firm, and might have been more comfy than the air mattress in retrospect.  All told this was one of the best airbnb experiences I've had -- not only a very nice unit but a wonderful host who provided several considerate little touches and was very helpful and responsive without intruding at all. Thank you Lana! I would absolutely stay here again.\n",

      " - In my experience of staying in dozens and dozens of Airbnb properties, there are two types of units.  The first is used as an investment property and is professionally managed like much like a hotel.  Immaculately cleaned, no personal belongings, fresh towels, basic essentials provided (e.g. coffee pods, a bottle of water, small shampoo/soap, etc).  The second type is someone's home and they are renting it out periodically while they are out of town.  Armin's unit falls into that second category. While the unit was in a nice location, Armin was easy to communicate with and check-in/check-out went smoothly, it was clearly a unit that is his primary residence.  Personal belongings were abound, his toiletries lined the bathroom, personal notes/calendar on the refrigerator, etc.  Not that any of that is bad, but for me, it has the uncomfortable vibe that I'm crashing over at some guys house that I don't know instead of staying in a hotel. Of course, this alone isn't worth a 2-star review, however, when paired with the cleanliness of the unit, it was.  Frankly, I'm not entirely convinced that the unit was professionally cleaned at all.  There was items in the dishwasher, the bed was made, but clearly not by a professional cleaning crew (actually, to be fair, it looked similar to the bed in his  Airbnb listing images) and surfaces in the kitchen, bathroom, etc just seemed quickly wiped down, not cleaned/sanitized.  Additionally, the bath towels were old and tattered and there was mold lining the bottom of the shower curtain.  So, for me, the combination of the \"sleeping in someone's apartment\" vibe AND not feeling the apartment was properly cleaned (or perhaps cleaned at all) made this probably my most disappointing Airbnb experiences in 15 years of renting. I paid twice what it would have cost to stay a block away in the Holiday Inn Express and I probably would have been 100% less freaked out by the experience.  So while there were good and bad aspects of this rental, it wasn't for me.\n",

The top floor is unused on the weekends making the space quiet and relaxing.

      " - Loved our stay at Suzanna's while in Toronto! Suzanna is a great hostesse who checked in on us throughout our stay via message to make sure everything was up to standard and that we didn't need anything. A nice touch on service without being intrusive during our stay! Her place fell into the $ budget we were looking to spend while visiting, and perfectly located for all we wanted to see & do. The photos of the space are what drew our attention to book, and upon arrival we were immediately at home with our temporary dwelling. It is a spacious & very well decorated and furnished spot. It is an ideal spot for visitors who want to see the sights & experience the city as much as possible, but also have a great spot to come back to and chill out & relax from the days events. For us, the location was perfect. We met in Toronto 5 years ago, so this was a bit of an anniversary trip, and also our first real time alone together since the birth of our daughter! We were close to all the meaningful spots from early on in our relationship (Queen West, Ossington, Trinity Bellwoods, Edulis restaurant). For those looking to shop or have a multitude of options for an evening out, this space is ideally located. We brought our bikes but we ended up walking everywhere during our stay.  We cannot say enough nice things about Suzanna's space, and highly recommend it. We will 100% try to book it again if we make any future trips to TO!\n",

There is a convenient and cost efficient parking garage next door to the apartment building (it cost us $27 to park our car from 3pm Friday to 2pm Sunday, much cheaper than other alternatives) Another huge plus is that the apartment building is located within a 5 minute walk to a Starbuck's for morning coffee and a drug store in case you forgot to pack something!

      " - To be honest when I booked this air bnb for my birthday I didn’t realize it was shared, I messaged the host right away after I paid and told her it was a mistake. She proceeded to tell me that she cannot refund me and took my 245$. Upon checking in we had a hard time getting into the building also while running into another couple that was staying in the same apartment as us…my boyfriend and I found this very weird as we like our personal space and we kinda felt forced to stay here cause we would lose out on so much money. The picture of the balcony is also incorrect you cannot see the CN tower as there is a building in the way, this to me brings down the value of what we paid. We didn’t use the common area as the other couple was out there and we just found it awkward. Lastly we asked the concierge for assistance to get into the air bnb and he told us to not tell him that so we assume this building doesn’t allow air bnb. I was pretty disappointed with my stay and will not be back.\n",

Get a Presto card and load $20 on it.  That will sort bus, tram, underground to get anywhere down town.  The train runs to Dundas ($6) from the airport with a short bus ride to the top of the street using your Presto. Green restaurant next to the park,  with black,  grey and white squirrels is fab!

You have to know it is really not! The problem was, we could hear everything from conversations to footsteps and even the *dog’s* footsteps! As it is a basement and the family lives upstairs, we understand the ceiling would need to be soundproofed to not hear anything. We have to admit we really didn’t sleep well because of that. As the family gets up very early (at around 5-6), that’s when we’d wake up as well… and when they’d walk around during the night, we’d wake up then too… I do admit to being a light sleeper and I know I stay alert no matter what but my friend who’s more of a heavy sleeper did wake up as well. Just something to keep in mind! Ruchu and her family are the most wonderful hosts though. We really cannot say otherwise. I wish we’d have slept better but we don’t think it was Ruchu’s family fault for living life!!\n",

      " - Airbnb review My wife and I stayed here for about three weeks. Check-in was painless enough, and while the wifi didn't work when we first arrived, it was solved soon enough. Let's start with the pros: * It's in a quiet, residential neighborhood.  * It is indeed spacious — it's literally an entire basement * There's a small, separate room with an ironing board and iron (if you're doing any sort of recording it's surprisingly good, if a little echo-y).  * A good supermarket is about a 400 meter walk, and bus 16 stops about 200 meters away. * All the appliances you'd expect in a modern, Western, first-world place are present: fridge, coffeemaker, microwave, oven/stovetop. Now, the cons. * In 20+ countries and dozens of Airbnb's, this has got to be the loudest bed we have ever heard. It was not possible to get into or out of the bed without waking my wife. Even shifting from one side to the other was noisy. If you're by yourself, this probably won't matter all that much. * The kitchen is minimally equipped — three plates. Two bowls. A handful of cups. A few pots and pans. No small plates. No baking pans. Nothing that a small investment of the host's wouldn't fix, so this may not be relevant to you now, future reader... * Heating and/or air-con are not directly under your control. It's a central system that's controlled from upstairs. The host is quick enough to change it per your request, of course. * 'Quiet' refers to the neighborhood — but when the four-year-old above your head decides to cry, drop a ball, or run around the house, you'll know it. If they're blending, vacuuming, or coughing, you'll hear it... and I have to believe it goes the other way around. * Because the house is shared with other people, the washer and dryer is apparently only available on the weekends. This is disclosed in the booking notes, but is easy to overlook and just a bit annoying. * There's very little else to see within a kilometer's walking distance, and it's a fairly long subway ride on line 2 to get into Toronto proper. The Scarborough GO station is about 850 meters away and connects to Union Station, so you're good if you're going downtown. Overall, reasonably priced and relatively easy to access if wanting to live like a local.\n",

      " - Nirvana and Luise are such a sweet and lovely couple. They are kind, friendly and considerate host and hostess. They keep their apartment clean and neat. The location is nice because it is easy to reach downtown from the apartment. They did their best to treat me as one of their family members. I loved staying there and this sweet couple. It is highly recommended to stay here~!!\n",

      " - Shannon and Fred's place is just perfect in all respects.The place is about a 100 or so meters to a street car station, grocery shops including a NoFrills and a Walmart are closeby. The street its located on is very quiet. To top it, Riverdale public library and a big park with an amazing view of Toronto skyline are a 5-6 min walk. Talking about the fascilities, There are all the appliances and utensils that you will need. The internet is fast, a smart cable tv is there too, and the place feels really cozy and comfortable. There is an electric fireplace too and it works. Shannon is always there in person or via the app to help and give tips. They really are superhosts~.\n",

      " - I checked in to 148 Overture Road on September 4th, 2023, and my stay ended on September 10th, 2023. When I arrived, the host, Ayokunle, was waiting in his personal vehicle and gave me a friendly greeting and welcomed me to his home. He showed me to my room and we had a friendly chat about the important things to know for my stay. In the following days, I enjoyed my time in Room #003, which had new things such as bedding, a bedside lamp, and a waste basket, and this room has a nice view of the backyard. Much of the rest of the building is also equipped with new furniture and appliances. On one of the nights, there was an urgent matter to attend to that required immediate action, and after informing Ayokunle, he was able to quickly take care of the situation. Throughout the duration of my stay, Ayokunle was available both in-person and via online message. I believe that this stay was well worth it, and I would gladly stay here again.\n",

      " - Our stay was overall good, the layout of condo liked very much, but could have been better.  Was not happy with walking in and seeing trash on kitchen and living floors, feeling trash under your feet as you walk into bedrooms, floors not swept good at all. MB 2 Light bulbs were out, both tv's in MB and living room did not work entire   time we were there. addressed issues with host. BD rm #2 missing blind partitions in room unable to get good night rest due to light shining into rooms as well as privacy, same issue in BD #3 very thin blinds in room again poor privacy. I feel host needs address these issues.  The location is very good with that said.   There should been more information provided from host on things such as restaurants for breakfast, etc. as well on instructions on usage of TV's, in condo only able to access Netflix 1 night. I would defiantly as a host provide better window coverings in condo. Also, whomever cleaning your condo they can do a better job!\n",

      " - Great option for a last-minute stay in Toronto -- I used it in between my rental leases.  The best part of this room was, in my opinion, the privacy. Firstly, there’s a private entrance. Room #3 is located in between the kitchen and washroom which is very convenient. I never met other guests during my stay.  Wifi was sufficient for my online job, all good there.  The Little Italy area is also very cute and there’s everything you could ever need + a short streetcar ride to downtown core.  Worth the affordable price!\n",

      " - The house is situated in a really nice neighbourhood surrounded by different cafés, restaurants and bistros that can be easily reached by food.  We did a self check-in as we arrived late in the evening at Darren and Derek's house. The check-in was really easy and we met both of them the next day. We came by rental car and they even offered us a parking space behind their house, so we didn't need to park on the street.  The apartment looked exactly the way it is displayed in the pictures. It is well equipped and the furniture is nicely picked. We really enjoyed our stay at their house and upon arrival a few complementary snacks and cold drinks were waiting for us to be eaten.  The best part was that Darren amd Derek told us we could use their just newly installed rooftop terrace from which you can see the CN Tower from the distance. Their house is really nice and they have just finished their new home. When we made the booking, we didn't know about the rooftop terrace, because when making the booking they just had finished one apartment (#1b). The rooftop terrace and the other two apartments had just been finished a few weeks ago. So everything is really new. One day we wanted to go Niagara Falls, which is about an 1.5 - 2 hour drive from Toronto, and they recommended us to go to a winery. That was a really great idea and we stopped at 30 BENCH which was really nice. If you like to enjoy really good coffee you should visit PILOT COFFEE ROASTERS that is just a few minutes by foot (freshly roasted direct trade coffee is served at their roastery at 50 Wagstaff Dr.). And a few steps further down you can find a local brewery where you can taste a fresh and fruity sour beer or IPA.  There are a lot of different tastes around Darren and Derek's house that are wainting for you to be explored. And if you like to go to downtown Toronto, you can easily go by street car from Queen St East at Alton Ave. But you should bring cash with you as they have stopped payment by credit card. We would definetly come back to stay at Darren and Derek's house and will recommend it to friends and family.  Thank you Darren and Derek - we had a great stay at your house.\n",

My travel to Toronto was a stopping area on my travels to Mont-Tremblant for my Ironman. I was worried about having issues with storing my bikes. Helen made those worries disappear. She replies promptly and was able to cater to my needs. The space was super clean. Parking is actually in a garage - awesome. Only thing that would be an issue is if you're over 6 foot tall and are claustrophobic. The living quarters had a low ceiling height. Otherwise all is good. =]\n",

The condo itself was spotless and he had thought of everything from toothbrushes, shampoo in the bathroom to tea coffee and cereal and Cable TV. There is great security for those who are concerned about safety if travelling alone as well, having said that I never felt unsafe in Toronto while I was there. Great place to visit. We would definitely recommend Hady and his condo if you are ever looking for a place to stay in downtown Toronto.\n",

After leaving another AirBNB due to a prior, unrelated bad experience, we arrived @ Frants's place after midnight, was able to check in and the host was SUPER responsive. I appreciate how they allowed us to check in so easily. The next morning, we ran into Frants on the street near the location, and they were super nice and welcoming. Frants offered up local recommendations and was extremely warm and friendly. The location is key, easy to hop on / off the street car and walk to places. Nearby grocery store is high quality and ease of access. Quiet location, even for being right off the street, it's easy to tuck away here. Super clean and has amenities for cooking and cleaning, which are appreciated when traveling. We would definitely stay here again and highly recommend.\n",

      " - This is by far one of the best experiences I have had with Airbnb. The place was exactly as showed in the pictures, it was clean and neat. All the furniture look nice, nothing old or damaged. We had access to Netflix in the TV, Wi-Fi and a portable heater, beside the central unit of the house. There is a small fridge, enough space to chill and enjoy by the TV, it was quite and peaceful. The bathroom was super clean, provided with towels and bathing supplies, absolutely everything we need was there. I have to share also the experience I had which showed me how good host Andrew was: I arrived around 3 AM in my first night and there was a weird situation with the electronic lock. There was a key to the door in the room which I forgot (totally my mistake) so I had no other way but to call him at that time to explain the situation. I was afraid of the answer since is no good to wake up somebody at that time, but Andrew just answer quickly I'm my first attempt, with a nice chill attitude he guided me to solve the problem and open the door finally. I was so relieved that he didn't sound mad or anything over the phone (I would definitely would have been if somebody call me at that time :@). So yeah, not enough words of gratitude for everything he offered. 5 stars stay\n",

      " - The place is nice, but the longer you look at the shower the moldier you realize it is. The thing that really made this disappointing is how rude this host was to me when there was a misunderstanding about an early check-in. Refused to answer my calls when I had to sit on the lobby floor for an hour waiting to access the key, and when the doorman did me the courtesy of getting in touch for me and handing me the phone, I was promptly told that \"check in [was] at 4\" and that I shouldn't have shown up earlier, despite previously agreeing that the host would let me know if earlier check-in was possible the same morning and then hearing nothing. I am very, very disappointed with how I was treated, especially considering how much I paid to stay in that apartment for only one night. If I could have given check-in and communication a 0/5, I would have. This completely sullied my experience in the city.\n",

      " - I stayed in the room–on the second floor–with the window facing the backyard for several weeks. I mostly worked from home. • Shelly is welcoming, conversational, and matter-of-fact. She is very active, busy, but accommodating and resourceful at the same time. She was always communicative and receptive when I needed something, or if there was a temporary problem in the house (heat, hot water, or kitchen-related). • Location: 5 min to a bus stop, 10 min to major grocery store, tram line, many stores and restaurants on St Claire, and 20 min walk North to Eglinton for more African or Jamaican restaurants. Several laundromats 10 min walk away—I preferred Bruno's. The neighborhood is full of seniors, or families with very young children. • The bedroom was cozy, spacious and felt private (with they key lock) for me. It's furnished with a twin-sized bed, desk, closet, dresser, book shelf, and beside table. • There's a florescent light (white light) on the wall and small desk lamp (warm light) that flickers but fine when you adjust it into the right position. During the days, the room was filled with natural light. I recommend a sleeping mask because it's quite bright in spite of the blinds. •  The house is kept warm, although the bedroom temperature feels quite exposed to the outside [weather]; I was rather chilly although even with a heating vent under the desk. Shelly also provided a reliable space heater. • The twin-sized bed squeaks with certain movements, but mostly fine. I slept well on the firm mattress.  • The internet was generally reliable but would become cripplingly slow a few times a day. Luckily, a public library is 8 min walk away which has fast, reliable internet. • The hot water, and water pressure in the bathroom is excellent. • While the structure of the decades-old house is strong, sounds from within travels through the house clearly. I couldn't hear noises from outside the house. However, I could hear people using the bathroom, the hallway outside the bedroom door, and kitchen—where most of the family, and activity, situate when at home. The sound of the running fish tank reaches the bedroom, which could either be an ambient sound, or trigger on your bladder. I really enjoyed it when I could sit in the sun-lit porch during the day. • There's a lot packed into the very equipped kitchen. Shelly will make space when I asked, or needed space to cook/eat. I preferred working around their schedule, and cooking (simple recipes) separately. The stovetop, and microwave are best. The oven works but is packed with equipment. • The disabled, senior dog is a sweet heart. I'm not very experienced with dogs, but it should be better if you establish boundaries so he knows not to ask you for food, or to be released from his crate (he's comfortable in it). He can't control his poops, so be aware of him on the floor, or the smell if it's in the crate. It's cleaned right away when the adults are home. • Perhaps the biggest effect on my stay was the senior family member living in the house. (A caretaker comes for a few hours almost every day to care for her—they are very friendly and professional.) She is gentle, and has a benign fixation with opening doors. When she's unsupervised, or on the move during dark hours in the mornings, she will knock and try to open doors throughout the house. Eventually, she accepted my presence, and stopped knocking on my bedroom but it takes time [for you and her] to adjust. I would also warn future guests to be cautious with foods (packaged, being cooked, or served/exposed), because she will try to access foods within her sight and reach. When this happened, Shelly was apologetic and compensated the errors—I appreciated her responses.\n",

There is a bus stop on the corner and subway/train stations within a 12 minute walk. Don't rely solely on Google, try to figure out the public transportation system for yourself.

The location itself help allow visitors to appreciate all the cultural and life Toronto provides. Every main attractions of a developed city from the exciting party lifestyle [downtown clubs], classic Chinatown, romantic resorts [Sugar Beach], vintage weekly farmers market [St. Lawrence Market] and cultural gathering [Distillery District and Kensington Market] are less than 30 minute walking distance. This location is right in the middle of countless attractions which allows perfect exploration by foot,  but if necessary, Uber or taxi service is available for less than 15 CAD to reach all your travel needs. With Diane's fluid availability and thoughtfulness, my friends and myself would love going back to Toronto and would even love to rent this place again.\n",

      " - Phil's apartment is the perfect place for a Toronto trip. The Apartment is in a beautiful quiet and green neighbourhood in the West of Toronto downtown. (To the cn tower: 50 min walking, 30 min Streetcar, 35 min bike (a bike rental station is in the next Street)). There are plenty beautiful Restaurants and supermarkets in the area. Phil is a nice host, who answers really fast. So in a nutshell: stay at Phil's and you will have a nice trip to Toronto. {Traveled with 2 Persons}\n",

      " - Great value for the price. Super conscientious host! She is friendly and goes out of her way to ensure that guests are comfortable. Clean, cozy room in a warm home with very cute vintage look. Nice touches like a coffee maker included in the room. So kind that it is pet friendly and she left two doggie dishes with fresh water <3. Didn't expect the Tv with Roku either! Loved the Marylin theme! I enjoyed watching the night sky turn light through the tree branches from my cozy bed. The bathroom is shared with 2 other guests and \"quiet time\" is 10 pm so best for a guest who likes to rise in the day & chill at night {that's me!}. The kitchen is appropriate for simple meal prep with a small counter, table/chairs & love seat. Best not to do a big grocery shop of items that need fridge space as it is shared. Had great conversations with the host and another guest in the common area! For guests with mobility issues note the Marylin is on the 2nd level & the few stairs are a bit steep. But no stairs to the bathroom once in the room which is super convenient. As an Indian food fanatic I was happy to discover I was only 500 m walk to \"Little India\" and my favourite restaurant The  Regency that I have driven into Toronto to visit many times over the years. Yes, I indulged! A Parking permit is available from the City of Toronto website currently in 2021, $33 for a week. It was not a challenge to find parking near the Tiny Hotel. The host is a gem of a person <3 Hope to keep in touch :) Thank you for all your kindness!\n",

      " - La maison est propre, ainsi que la chambre. Faire attention de ne pas faire de bruit.  La maison est bien situé et proche d'une pharmacie, d'un supermarché et de plusieurs restaurants et boutiques. Le métro Bathurst (ligne verte) et Spadina (ligne jaune | amène au centre ville) sont à quelques minutes de marche. Si vous voulez vous rendre au centre ville, en prenant la ligne jaune (station Spadina) cela vous prend moins de 20 minutes.   Agréable séjour.\n",

      " - I had a great stay here, the place was very nice and clean and my bed was very comfortable. I would suggest bringing extra towels since they only offer one towel per person. I also suggest bringing a small mirror for yourself since theres no mirror in the room and since other people stay there, the washroom isn’t always available. And slippers!!!! or anything to keep ur feet warm because the floors are very cold. The wifi also doesn’t work here, i had to use my data my whole trip :|\n",

      " - James and Rachel set the tone for my stay solely by being hospitable! They ensured someone was home to check me in and to give me a tour of the space. Without having to ask, Rachel gave me a rundown of all the \"to-dos\" in the area and James provided me with all I needed to know about public transportation and commuting. To say I felt 100% welcomed is an understatement. Now, the space! The images provided are not only of great quality but beyond accurate. James and Rachel's space has to be the most unique and thoughtfully curated Airbnb I've ever experienced. The artwork in the dining|kitchen area is a guide to all there is to do in the junction and downtown area (again, unique!). The small vases of lavender, matched with the black and white toiletries in the bathroom were a super cute touch and contributed to what was already an aesthetically pleasing atmosphere. I can say so much more but I'll end with I truly recommend you stay here. I'd be surprised if you leave having not felt like you were at home. Thank you again for such a wonderful stay James and Rachel!\n",

      " - Mara is a great host! She was responsive and helped us with all our concerns. It was very comfortable to stay at her place. The kitchen was clean and well equipped - in fact Mara provided additional resources (a roller pin and a blanket). We were also able to park our car in the parking spot outside the side - though it was a compact spot, it was ideal for our use case. The location is ideal considering the proximity to the closest grocery store (Loblaws), transit station (Christie) and highway (401). If you have a car you can basically reach any part of Toronto GTA quickly (of course depending on Toronto Traffic). The Airbnb also had a washer and dryer that really helped us be ready for the next half of our trip. TIP - The classic Casa Loma is walking distance! TL;DR | It was a 5-star experience, where the Airbnb met our expectations and the host exceeded expectations! Recommended for a great Toronto midtown experience.\n",
