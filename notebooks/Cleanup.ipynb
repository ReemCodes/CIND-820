She went out of her way to meet us at a restaurant to bring us the keys etc for the check in. Which we greatly appreciated as it made everything very easy from there.

The only downside of our visit was the several real estate agent viewings, which meant we had to make sure we were out of the apartment for several hours and couldn't leave anything out.

Thanks, Airbnb!    2-story, classic, older Toronto house....but at the same time, he gracefully allows the guest whatever degree of sociability or solitude might be preferred.  In my case, for example, we enjoyed wide-ranging and animated conversations over espresso and bowls of delicious fresh fruit and yogurt that he served in the early morning. Then I was “off” for the day and evening (mostly visiting my relatives, whose residence is in close walking distance—again, perfectly convenient for my needs).  I had a key in hand so I could let myself back into the house if I wished to return during the day to enjoy the cool haven of the garden or to grab something I needed from my luggage, and later in the evening to quietly retire to my room if Steve were not still up and about. In short, I felt quite “at home” – which is nice! \n",

We recommend her space for families, couples or even single travelers.   Thanks again!d space to spread out throughout the house, especially in the garden.  It truly was an urban oasis out in the yard, thankfully we had gorgeous weather and we spent a lot of stay there.   We were in town for a birthday celebration but the festivities of Canada Day and Pride month added excitement and variety to our vacation. The breakfast groceries were a nice touch, along with the thoughtful bottle of wine and libations for the birthday lady upon our arrival.

We had an excellent stay at Cole and Jane ́s house, and would certainly stay again. Cole and Jane are extremely warm and welcoming.

Thats something I had never encountered for such an affordable airbnb listing! The place was clean and the beds were comfortable, not much more you could ask for.

Very noisy “garden”.<br/>The pictures do NOT portray the real place. <br/>The  “11 foot ceilings, hardwood floors, oversized windows” etc., ARE NOT FOR THE REGULAR GUESTS, the pictures in the description portray the owner’s space “upstairs” NOT the Airbnb Basement. <br/>Old, smelly bed linens and towels were provided. <br/>The son of the owner was often using Cannabis (cbd) in a room next to ours and the smoke permeated the space. <br/>Our food, even if labeled, was taken several times. Sometimes, by the son of the owner. In one occasion he gave a bite to a sausage and left it inside the bag, in the refrigerator.<br/>The neighborhood is not nice to walk. It does not feel safe.

Same BASEMENT.<br/>In the first room, one of the “beds” was just 3 mattresses, one on top of the other. The second room had very wobbly mattresses absolutely unhealthy for the back.<br/>One of the rooms has a very disturbing machine by one of its walls inside the closet. Which produces a definitively NOT HEALTHY vibration and a subtle sound 24/7.<br/>Small and dirty windows in that basement. <br/>Bushes from outside block the light.<br/>There are NO Fire Detectors working in the space.<br/>There are notices and warnings in the kitchen, washrooms and rooms reading for instance: “After defecation and urination…”. Language all, but proper.<br/>“Be prepared to meet the world in our home” is not because of the variety of travellers, but because the owner seems to rent every centimeter of the house and so there will be random parties and meetings in the Main Floor of the house, with or without loud music, which vibrations on the floor are obviously heard and felt down in the basement, if you are trying to sleep. The “guests” of these parties used the “Airbnb” washroom in various occasions. <br/>We felt that the owner was discriminatory in many respects towards us, but she seems not to accept well criticisms so she claimed to be explanatory, not discriminatory. She always justified every single issue addressed.<br/>During the stay she made a renovation on the rooftop and no DANGER signs were set, so coming in and out the house with the workers up in the roof, high levels of noise, wood everywhere and things (tiles) falling down was a not SAFE situation.<br/>The description reads: “you are welcome to use our kitchen upstairs … fireplace, guitars on the main floor…” we were NEVER offered those. But we were “invited” to her parties. Which for the overall situation I preferred to decline.<br/>I limited myself to the basics leaving around 7 am coming back around 7 pm.<br/>In the description it reads: “Guest staying for a week or more MAY have laundry facilities available to them” we never had. <br/>The porch where one is supposed to leave the shoes is permeated with a strong smell to cat.<br/>The description says that the owner’s cats are not allowed in the Airbnb space but she used to leave the door of the kitchen open, which is were you get down to the basement, and in various occasions the cats got in. In one occasion I found one of the cats sleeping in the carpet of the shower.<br/>I felt the space more like a hostel than a proper “family” Airbnb house.<br/>The day I arrived I asked the owner if I could take my morning coffee upstairs, by the big windows, in the big wooden table that is in the pictures and she replied: <br/>“You can have it in the garden”. <br/>I stayed for almost 3 months in this place, paid the equivalent to $4840 Euros<br/>After the BIG MONEY payment, before moving in, the instructions to the house arrived and I realized it was a basement. <br/>Very disappointed because I was avoiding that kind of spaces I wrote asking the owner: <br/>Is it a Basement!? It took her more than 12 hours to reply saying: <br/>It is “the lower parts of the house”… <br/>Couldn’t just be clean and clear describing the space as a BASEMENT?. Given that me and my brother were busy and could not afford more time looking for a place, we moved in, knowing that according to her rules, she will not give us our money back. <br/>When I landed in the place I was already dissatisfied knowing that it was a basement but the several events after our arrival, the fact that the description and pictures were not sincere and accurate and the overall behavior of the owner just made our everyday experience unbearable. <br/>Not recommended. to It is a BASEMENT. <br/>No “view” to the “LAKE”.

The trendy coffee shops, galleries etc., area starts 10 blocks from there.<br/>In winter there was NO heating in the washrooms/shower.<br/>We stayed in 2 different rooms one of those called ACROSS FROM THE LAKE but nowadays called “Roncie Village”. Same BASEMENT.<br/>In the first room, one of the “beds” was just 3 mattresses, one on top of the other. The second room had very wobbly mattresses absolutely unhealthy for the back.<br/>One of the rooms has a very disturbing machine by one of its walls inside the closet. Which produces a definitively NOT HEALTHY vibration and a subtle sound 24/7.<br/>Small and dirty windows in that basement. <br/>Bushes from outside block the light.<br/>There are NO Fire Detectors working in the space.<br/>There are notices and warnings in the kitchen, washrooms and rooms reading for instance: “After defecation and urination...”. Language all, but proper.<br/>“Be prepared to meet the world in our home” is not because of the variety of travellers, but because the owner seems to rent every centimeter of the house and so there will be random parties and meetings in the Main Floor of the house, with or without loud music, which vibrations on the floor are obviously heard and felt down in the basement, if you are trying to sleep. The “guests” of these parties used the “Airbnb” washroom in various occasions. <br/>We felt that the owner was discriminatory in many respects towards us, but she seems not to accept well criticisms so she claimed to be explanatory, not discriminatory. She always justified every single issue addressed.<br/>During the stay she made a renovation on the rooftop and no DANGER signs were set, so coming in and out the house with the workers up in the roof, high levels of noise, wood everywhere and things (tiles) falling down was a not SAFE situation.<br/>The description reads: “you are welcome to use our kitchen upstairs ... fireplace, guitars on the main floor...” we were NEVER offered those. But we were “invited” to her parties. Which for the overall situation I preferred to decline.<br/>I limited myself to the basics leaving around 7 am coming back around 7 pm.<br/>In the description it reads: “Guest staying for a week or more MAY have laundry facilities available to them” we never had. <br/>The porch where one is supposed to leave the shoes is permeated with a strong smell to cat.<br/>The description says that the owner’s cats are not allowed in the Airbnb space but she used to leave the door of the kitchen open, which is were you get down to the basement, and in various occasions the cats got in. In one occasion I found one of the cats sleeping in the carpet of the shower.<br/>I felt the space more like a hostel than a proper “family” Airbnb house.<br/>The day I arrived I asked the owner if I could take my morning coffee upstairs, by the big windows, in the big wooden table that is in the pictures and she replied: <br/>“You can have it in the garden”. <br/>I stayed for almost 3 months in this place, paid the equivalent to $4840 Euros<br/>After the BIG MONEY payment, before moving in, the instructions to the house arrived and I realized it was a basement. <br/>Very disappointed because I was avoiding that kind of spaces I wrote asking the owner: <br/>Is it a Basement!? It took her more than 12 hours to reply saying: <br/>It is “the lower parts of the house”... <br/>Couldn’t just be clean and clear describing the space as a BASEMENT?. Given that me and my brother were busy and could not afford more time looking for a place, we moved in, knowing that according to her rules, she will not give us our money back. <br/>When I landed in the place I was already dissatisfied knowing that it was a basement but the several events after our arrival, the fact that the description and pictures were not sincere and accurate and the overall behavior of the owner just made our everyday experience unbearable. <br/>Not recommended.\n",

I decided to spend several days in Toronto and I was on the hunt for a beautiful space with good vibes and a meditative and relaxing feel to it.  Plus, I needed it to be centrally located with easy access to EVERYTHING.  Needless to say, after hunting through several properties on Airbnb, I was drawn to Serafin’s place.  A characteristically charming heritage townhouse nestled within a quiet neighborhood in downtown Toronto and literally 2 minutes walk from Wellesley Train and Bus Station.  Definitely no need for a taxi.  It is also walking distance to food, supermarkets, cafes, banks, ATMs, pharmacies, currency changing depots, clubs, basically everything.  Though the pictures of the home are lovely and inviting, just being there in person is an even better experience that surpassed my expectations.  It’s a 3 storey house that I immediately felt right at home in.  Serafin was/is the sweetest host and a very honest person.  He greeted me upon arrival and helped me with my luggage.  He proceeded to give me a tour and ran over a few housekeeping rules to ensure that my stay would be easy.  I loved that we communicated so easily long before I landed in Toronto, and while I was there he checked in on me several times just to make sure that I was having a great time.  He was always just a phone call or message away and he responded very quickly.  He even drew me a map of several blocks with the best places to eat and for other activities and I followed it to the letter with great results.  A beautifully decorated, clean and fully equipped home with great energy - I did not want to leave during my day and there were times I literally had to force myself to leave in order to complete a few errands…But it was always great to return to his place just to unwind and relax.  Even though I was traveling alone and in the house by myself, and I felt completely safe at all times.  I was truly blessed to have found this place and to have met Serafin.  I found no fault or had any issues during my stay at his home.   I would definitely recommend this place to anyone.  And when you do go, you must meet Frank, Serafin’s neighbor.

      "Normalization changed text: Context:  We stayed for the month of December 2020.  Two weeks of which were a mandatory self-quarantine, as we flew in from California.<br/>Pros:<br/>- Maggie is responsive<br/>- Views are as described<br/>- no problems with wifi<br/>- shower water pressure was good<br/>- has a Dyson vacuum cleaner <br/>Cons:<br/>- The apartment was tidy, but I wouldn't describe it as clean-- it would benefit from a deep, professional clean. (Examples: sticky door handles, dusty shelves, icky light switches, etc)<br/>- So much doesn't work, which is fine if it's your own house and you know all the tricks, but this place is loaded with post-its warning you to watch out, to not touch, to not unplug, to not \"peek at the neighbors\"?? Very odd. (Examples:  outlets and blinds that don't work)<br/>- We stayed for a month, and the host knew we had to quarantine for two weeks, but no pantry space was cleared for us. The kitchen was also missing some very basic essentials -- I had to buy a dozen items (the host reimbursed me, no problem). <br/>- In general, I think the description oversells this place.  (Example: The \"high quality countertops\" in the bathrooms are the basic white cork board it came with, and are actually chipped.) The appliances are very old-- dishwasher, washer, dryer are SO LOUD, the middle of the apartment, and circa 1980s.  You cannot take a phone call if the washing machine is running. (ps- the pods in the Tide pod bag are not Tide, they're a knock off -- be warned if you have sensitive skin/allergies)<br/>- I was uncomfortable with the live camera *inside* the apartment, even though it was just pointing at the door. <br/>If you're in the city for a sporting event, wedding, etc, for a few days, it'll definitely do the trick, especially if you're 4+ people.  If you're self-quarantining and need to actually live, work, and cook here 24/7, maybe not.  to Context:  We stayed for the month of December 2020.  Two weeks of which were a mandatory self-quarantine, as we flew in from California.<br/>Pros:<br/>- Maggie is responsive<br/>- Views are as described<br/>- no problems with wifi<br/>- shower water pressure was good<br/>- has a Dyson vacuum cleaner <br/>Cons:<br/>- The apartment was tidy, but I wouldn't describe it as clean-- it would benefit from a deep, professional clean. (Examples: sticky door handles, dusty shelves, icky light switches, etc)<br/>- So much doesn't work, which is fine if it's your own house and you know all the tricks, but this place is loaded with post-its warning you to watch out, to not touch, to not unplug, to not \"peek at the neighbors\"?? Very odd. (Examples:  outlets and blinds that don't work)<br/>- We stayed for a month, and the host knew we had to quarantine for two weeks, but no pantry space was cleared for us. The kitchen was also missing some very basic essentials -- I had to buy a dozen items (the host reimbursed me, no problem). <br/>- In general, I think the description oversells this place.  (Example: The \"high quality countertops\" in the bathrooms are the basic white cork board it came with, and are actually chipped.) The appliances are very old-- dishwasher, washer, dryer are SO LOUD, the middle of the apartment, and circa 1980s.  You cannot take a phone call if the washing machine is running.

      "Normalization changed text: The location is amazing, the host seems nice overall but she is unfit to professionally manage an airbnb. Firstly there is a negative review of her place i read that states her bedroom door and kitchen lights are broken, but since the review was from months ago i assumed she must have fixed those issues and booked anyways. When i arrived at the place with all my stuff, i was shocked to see the door was off the hinges, kitchen lights not working, place wasnt cleaned properly at all, her entry door hinges were broken aswell and scraped the ceiling every time you open the door. I felt stuck and it was so hard for me to hastily book another place on the spot, especially with all my stuff already there She offered me $500 discount and promised to send another cleaner and get lights fixed. (She sent cleaner two days later but lights were never fixed). Because i just moved to canada a couple months ago and super busy, i ignored and lived with the damages and was appreciative of $500 off. And location is simply amazing so i made the best of it……but suddenly at the end of my stay the day i moved out her place, i get an insane text and call of accusing me of sub-leasing the place simply because she was suspicious the netflix was set to arabic, which isnt my language (i didnt use her tv even once and her last tenant was arabic) she also accused me of running “some kind of sex operation” simply because there was a single hand print on the washroom mirror. Wow, I was shocked. Worse yet she sent me a picture of damage in her washroom saying i caused it. I was enraged to say the least and immediately explained how unfounded her accusations werr and sent her an identical picture of the washroom damage time stamped in my phone of oct 1, the day i moved in(thank god i took pics of all th damage). She felt embarrassed after i showd her evidence and told her how insane her accusations were. She clearly felt guilty but didnt apologize. Anyways i wish this host all the best. The location is amazing and if she fixes all the damage, and learns to not assume, this listing would be perfect.

You can go everywhere from Kaymar place pretty quickly.<br/>The apartment: the place looks like exactly as shown on the pictures. Even better in my opinion. Super clean, with all the appliances you will need (washer/dryer, dishwasher, fridge) and with everything you will need to prepare meals yourself. Bed is very comfortable, shower is great! <br/>Communication with the host: communication with Kaymar was always great. We arranged all we need by messages, which were all replied to within minutes: mothing to complain.  Check in and check out procedures were smooth as well. Kaymar was also super helpful when I faced a minor issue in the unit, with a clog: host arranged everything that I needed to deal with it in very short notice. <br/>Overall: Place is great! Host is great! I would definitely come back and I am more than confident to recommend Kaymar ́s place.\n",

From the moment I first made my reservation to the moment I checked out, Vasily communicated with me. I had NO issues, but felt if I did they would've been taken care of immediately.  I found the apartment to be perfect for a quick getaway to Toronto.  The place is spotless and well decorated.  The bed is extremely comfortable.  I enjoyed having access to Netflix after a day of touring.  Air temperature was perfect and the views from the balcony were nice.  I did take advantage of using the washer and dryer while I was there … great to go home with clean clothes!  Follow all of the directions carefully as you locate the FREE parking spot.  One of the reasons I chose this apartment is that it included a parking spot.  Definitely a perk. I did access the streetcar - both 509 and 511 stop is right outside the building entrance.   I will definitely stay here again the next time I'm in Toronto.  Thank you, Vasily, for creating a beautiful home to share! to I had a fantastic stay here.

That afternoon, he alerted me to a faulty additional charge of approximately 80 dollars that was tacked on to my booking fee. With his dogged help in interfacing with AirBnB customer service, I was able to re-book without the mysterious fee. I was especially impressed with his integrity, because 1) the extra money would have gone into his pocket if he hadn’t brought the matter to my attention; 2) he spent nearly an hour on the phone with AirBnB on my behalf; and 3) he kindly assisted me with the re-booking on his end. Truly exceptional. <br/>(New paragraph) <br/>My mother and I ended up thoroughly enjoying our stay in his flat in Toronto. It was clean, spacious, brightly lit with natural light, and warmly appointed, and there was more than enough room for both of us. The location on Bathhurst was perfect for walking to the Kensington Market, Chinatown, the University of Toronto, and more. Not only was it a wonderful place to come back to at the end of a long day seeing the city, but it was perfect for staying put and relaxing indoors on a cold and rainy day. We especially enjoyed the full kitchen, which helped us save money on food, as well as the washer and dryer, which allowed us to keep our clothes fresh throughout the week. <br/>(New paragraph)<br/>For the duration of our stay, Taras was highly attentive, supplying us, for example, with high-end (!) toilet paper when we needed it, and patiently walking us, multiple times, through the ins and outs of his big flat-screen TV. He generously offered to let me use his printer when I needed it for my conference presentation. On our final night, he even offered sterile ear plugs to us, as dejected, stranded GS Warriors fans, while the city of Toronto went (understandably…) bananas for hours on end over its first NBA title, at our expense. <br/>(New paragraph)<br/>In sum, Taras was fantastic, and anyone who stays at his flat is in for a real treat.  to Immediately after securing my reservation in April, I learned what an outstanding host Taras was.

      "Normalization changed text: The house itself was nice. The beds were comfortable, the wifi was fast, and it was close to public transport. The photos are very accurate. There was also a really nice smart tv. I did not like that it was listed as an entire place when the host actually lives in the basement, so you can easily hear them, and they actually have to come into the unit to use the bathroom. The bathroom that they use is separate from our bathrooms so we did have two private bathrooms but it was a bit weird to constantly hear someone coming and going in your unit to use the bathroom. Our biggest issue with the unit was that the heat was broken. It was around -2ºF so it was very cold outside and the heat would not go above 60°F, which is actually against Toronto's renting laws. The host was very difficult to get ahold of and when we could she would come upstairs, push a few buttons, and then make some promises that if the heat didn't come on soon she would get us some \"extra heat\" and then never did. Eventually, she gave up all together and told us that she called a technician and he wouldn't come out because of the holidays so there was nothing else that she could do. When I asked for a partial refund she never responded and I was forced to get the refund through AirBnb, who were great about the situation. Like I stated before, the house itself is very nice but the lack of heat was an inexcusable issue. The listing of the amenities in the house are inaccurate and should be revised. to The house itself was nice. The beds were comfortable, the wifi was fast, and it was close to public transport.

      "Normalization changed text: We all really enjoyed our time here, it was perfect! The house was so spacious and modern with so much beds, and most importantly it was so clean ! You had everything we needed, the kitchen was stocked, and there was so much good cleaning supplies and extra sheets.  I loved the kitchen and the open concept, and having the sliding doors out to the deck was soo nice! The second deck upstairs was even bigger and with the lights at night it was such a nice vibe. We had a great time I wish we could have stayed longer. There were no issues, but for anyone who is confused like I was to how the beds are set up, On the main floor is a big room with a queen bed and a bunk bed. When you go up the stairs there is the second bunk bed , it is not in a private room, kinda just off to the side in the hallway. It's really not a big deal, and actually a very smart use of the space. Just wanted to share that because I wish I knew that before I told my in-laws they'd have their own room and for anyone in the same boat. Thanks to the extra sheets and the fort idea, I put up a sheet around the bed to give it some privacy and made it work. And behind that there is a big room with a king bed and huge closet which I loved. I am so glad I got so lucky to get this place, it was exactly what I needed. Even though I didn't need anything, it was good to know you offered for me to reach out if I did,  Thank you Harry and Anna !

Communications were very easy with him throughout the entire stay. There was decent wifi, a well-appointed steam shower in a fantastic bathroom space, and the whole house was well planned out and furnished. It was exactly as pictured. The location was super convenient to College Street and the 506 public transit line that runs into downtown. Additionally, the neighborhood was packed with great bars and restaurants – but the house is a half block away from there and is super quiet. The check-in/check-out process was really simple with an electronic door access code, and Ron was willing to let us drop off bags before check-in and store bags after check-out. All-in-all, my friends and I had a terrific stay and would recommend for anyone to stay.

It is also very handy to public transport and subway if you don’t drive.<br/>It is in a very peaceful and quiet neighborhood...great for long walks surrounded by nature and birds. My kids definitely enjoyed the wonderful backyard oasis and the firepit. <br/>We really appreciated all the little extra touches and amenities like great wifi, the herb garden and green cleaning products. <br/>The host was very responsive, accommodating and incredibly nice.

We will definitely stay here again! Can’t say enough about them! Excellent hosts! Wish I could give them more than 5 stars!\n",

Didn’t get to use the pool since it wasn’t open yet, but it looked amazing. So close to everything and we walked from the train station. <br/>So many pluses in this place other than location… from the fruits, orange juice, timbits and wine that he left from us to the amazing soaps, shampoo and body lotion. <br/>The only minor negative was the windows barely open in the bedrooms and it was really hot for spring,  so the AC wasn’t on yet (decision of the building and not the owner). But the second night, Robert brought us fans and it helped a lot. He is a great host, caring and available. Thank you so much for this rental! to Perfect location, super clean and cute.

From the very thoughtful chocolates, coffee, and crisps, the house is simply beautiful, warm, and comfortable. The wifi signal is strong and ever-present and the house was spotless.

      "Normalization changed text: This unit was in a great location for what we needed…but… it was not as nice as the pictures suggest. The bed is a Double (not a Queen as described) and there was supposed to be garage parking for one car and we were not allowed to use the garage at all. So street parking or paid parking a bit of a walk away were the only options which were less than ideal and not what was listed as included in the Airbnb description. Note there is no television in this unit. Overall, this unit needs maintenance, updates, and some attention to detail.

I found public restrooms cleaner than this building... After expressing my concerns the co host refunded the cleaning fee. Just wished I knew what the space really looked like before booking :(\n",

We had everything we needed...the linen was clean and fresh and new, the kitchen had enough coffee for the week.  Laundry was a plus since we are not traveling home with a bunch on dirty clothes. The balcony was fantastic with a great northern view of the city skyline from the 52nd floor. Having a parking spot included with the unit is a huge benefit...the spot is on P5 so a few level to go down and up but no big deal!  Location was ideal...easy walk to Front Street, 2 blocks to the lake front.  there were 3 supermarkets within a block from us!!  I would high recommend this place for your visit to Toronto.\n",
      "Normalization changed text: Good location and neighborhood, feels pretty safe and quiet.  Moldy smell when entering the basement.  the room and everything in it felt wet, including mattress, bedding and toilet paper. Pillows have some unknown yellow stains on them, spare pillows were on the floor and none of them smelled clean, but the host said they are clean when I tell her about it.  So, I ended up using my own clothes as the pillow and slept in my sleeping bag.  For some reason, the host gave me the worst parking spot possible, it was hard to drive in and out with a short pole right in front of it.

My mom loved her stay and Meghan was an excellent host before during and after. <br/>Directly from my mother...<br/>I had the opportunity to spend 2 wonderful nights at Meghan’s AirBnB. You will find this basement suite very welcoming, provides privacy, and has all of the creature comforts that one would have in their own home. <br/>There’s a spacious living room area w/ comfortable furniture for lounging after a day exploring. The place is beautifully decorated. <br/>Meghan is an amazing host, who definitely thought of everything, but also wanted to be sure i was comfortable and had everything I needed. My stay was fantastic! I highly recommend this AirBnB.\n",
